# Constructor
This repository has simple Java programs that explain constructors in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)<br>
ðŸ“˜ **What is a Constructor?**<br>
A constructor is a special method in Java. It runs automatically when you create an object. It helps to set values or initialize things in a class.

 ðŸ’»**Whatâ€™s Inside This Repo?**<br>
Here are the types of constructors explained with examples:

âœ… **Default Constructor**<br>
This one has no parameters and sets default values.

âœ… **Parameterized Constructor**<br>
This constructor takes values as input and sets them in the object.

âœ… **Copy Constructor (Manual)**<br>
This is used to copy values from one object to another.
